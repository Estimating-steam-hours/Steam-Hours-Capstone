# Steam Hours Capstone Project
## Project Description

The gaming industry now makes more money than the film and music industry combined. We have decided to look into what makes a customer play games for large amounts of time. We will look into what features if any contribute to the number of hours and create a model to estimate the hours played for certain types of games.
