# Steam Hours Capstone Project
## Project Description

The gaming industry now makes more money than the film and music industry combined. We have decided to look into what makes a customer play games for large amounts of time. We will look into what features if any contribute to the number of hours and create a model to estimate the hours played for certain types of games.

## Project Goal

* Discover drivers of hours played from database
* Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to determine 
* This information could be used to further our understanding of which elements contribute to or detract from a person's tendency spend time on a game

## Initial Thoughts

We believe that Multiplayer games with a competitive element, such as battle royales like Fortnite, have the highest game hours. We believe that the games with the least amount of hours are horror genre games.
